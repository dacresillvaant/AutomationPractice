# AutomationPractice

Hello there,

purpose of this repo is to teach myself how to use Selenium with JAVA and create some automated tests.

## Technical details:

So far everything you would like to see is being pushed to master branch because I forgot to create a new one when initializing the project.

I'm currently working with Selenium which uses ChromeDriver that supports Chrome version 102.
Driver is located in 
> src/test/resources

Should you need to change it to driver which support your Chrome version you can download them from here:
> https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Object of my test is this website:
> http://automationpractice.com/index.php

To perform tests I'm using Junit Jupiter framework
